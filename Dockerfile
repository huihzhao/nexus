# Nexus server — single-image deploy (Python + Node).
#
# Two stages:
#   1. builder  — installs Python deps via uv into a venv. Pre-cached
#                 in CI layers so most rebuilds skip dependency resolve.
#   2. runtime  — slim Debian + Python 3.11 + Node 20 (for MCP installs)
#                 + a non-root nexus user. App code is copied last so
#                 source changes don't bust the heavier dep layer.
#
# Why Node lives in the runtime image: the agent is supposed to install
# new MCP servers + skills at chat time via manage_skill / manage_mcp,
# both of which shell out to `npx`. If Node isn't here, those tools
# fail with "npx not found" and the user has to redeploy. We ship Node
# so the "agent installs its own tools without code changes" promise
# actually holds.

# ── Stage 1: build (Python deps via uv) ───────────────────────────────
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm AS builder

# uv is the fastest known installer for the FastAPI + web3 + google-genai
# tree (the previous Poetry-based image took ~6 min to lock; uv does it
# in <30 s and the locked manifest is reproducible).
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir uv==0.4.30

# independently of source code changes.

# Install all three packages editable into a single venv.

# NOTE: deliberately NOT using `pip install -e ...` (editable) here.
# Editable installs write the source-tree absolute path into a `.pth`
# file inside the venv. In multi-stage Docker builds the builder stage's
# WORKDIR (`/build/...`) doesn't exist in the runtime stage (which only
# has `/app/...` after the COPY --from=builder step), so the .pth path
# resolves to nothing and Python can't find `nexus_server` at runtime
# (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nexus_server'`).
# Plain (non-editable) install copies the package contents into the
# venv's site-packages directly, decoupling import resolution from the
# source-tree path. The downside (no live edits without rebuild) is a
# non-issue for production images.

# ── Stage 2: runtime (slim + Node + non-root user) ───────────────────
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm AS runtime
