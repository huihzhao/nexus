#
# Nexus server — single-image deploy (Python + Node).
#
# Two stages:
#   1. builder  — installs Python deps via uv into a venv. Pre-cached
#                 in CI layers so most rebuilds skip dependency resolve.
#   2. runtime  — slim Debian + Python 3.11 + Node 20 (for MCP installs)
#                 + a non-root nexus user. App code is copied last so
#                 source changes don't bust the heavier dep layer.
#
# Why Node lives in the runtime image: the agent is supposed to install
# new MCP servers + skills at chat time via manage_skill / manage_mcp,
# both of which shell out to `npx`. If Node isn't here, those tools
# fail with "npx not found" and the user has to redeploy. We ship Node
# so the "agent installs its own tools without code changes" promise
# actually holds.

# ── Stage 1: build (Python deps via uv) ───────────────────────────────

# uv is the fastest known installer for the FastAPI + web3 + google-genai
# tree (the previous Poetry-based image took ~6 min to lock; uv does it
# in <30 s and the locked manifest is reproducible).

# NOTE: deliberately NOT using `pip install -e ...` (editable) here.
# Editable installs write the source-tree absolute path into a `.pth`
# file inside the venv. In multi-stage Docker builds the builder stage's
# WORKDIR (`/build/...`) doesn't exist in the runtime stage (which only
# has `/app/...` after the COPY --from=builder step), so the .pth path
# resolves to nothing and Python can't find `nexus_server` at runtime
# (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nexus_server'`).
# Plain (non-editable) install copies the package contents into the
# venv's site-packages directly, decoupling import resolution from the
# source-tree path. The downside (no live edits without rebuild) is a
# non-issue for production images.

# ── Stage 2: runtime (slim + Node + non-root user) ───────────────────
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm AS runtime

# Node 20 LTS for two purposes:
#   1. MCP server installs (agent calls `npx -y mcp-...` at runtime).
#   2. The Greenfield bridge — nexus_core/greenfield.py shells out to
#      packages/sdk/scripts/greenfield_daemon.cjs (and friends), which
#      `require("@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk")` + `ethers` + `long`.
#      Without those packages installed, every per-agent bucket creation
#      crashes with `Cannot find module '@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk'`,
#      and chain.py silently falls back to local storage. The desktop
#      then shows "in sync" while no data ever leaves the VPS — exactly
#      the bug we hit on agent #985 in production.
#
# curl + ca-certificates for the NodeSource bootstrap and any outbound
# HTTPS the agent needs (BSC RPC, Greenfield, Gemini, Tavily).

# Greenfield JS bridge deps. `npm install -g` puts them in
# /usr/lib/node_modules, and we set NODE_PATH (further down) so Node's
# module resolver consults the global prefix when running standalone
# .cjs scripts from anywhere on disk. Without NODE_PATH, the global
# install lands in the right directory but `require()` still can't
# find them — that footgun has bitten enough projects that it's worth
# the explicit comment.
#
# Pinning versions because greenfield-js-sdk's API has shifted across
# minor releases and the daemon's payload-shape probing doesn't cover
# every permutation. Bump these together with a daemon test run.
# NODE_PATH must be set BEFORE the validation runs in the same RUN
# below, otherwise `require.resolve()` only searches the cwd's
# node_modules tree and ignores the global prefix. ENV here makes it
# available to every subsequent layer's shell, including the validation
# below — and to the daemon's `node script.cjs` invocations at runtime.
ENV NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules

# Greenfield JS bridge deps — installed from packages/sdk/package.json
# (+ lock file) rather than pinned by hand, so local dev and the
# Docker image always agree on which @bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk
# major and which ethers major are in use.
#
# Why this mattered in production: an earlier rev of this Dockerfile
# pinned `@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk@1.2.4 ethers@6.13.2`. Local dev
# used `^2.2.2 / ^5.7.2` (per packages/sdk/package.json). The .cjs
# scripts were written against the v2 API + ethers v5; running them
# against v1 / ethers v6 produced a parade of cryptic errors —
# `authType is required`, `Cannot read properties of undefined
# (reading 'primarySpAddress')` — that all looked like "the script is
# broken" but were really "the script's runtime is wrong". Driving
# both environments off the SAME package.json is the only way to
# stop this from happening again.
#
# `npm ci` (vs `npm install`) refuses to fall back to resolution if
# package-lock.json doesn't match — so a stale lock file is a build-
# time error, not a silent drift.

# tried to read `process.cwd()` during boot. The `cd /` puts the
