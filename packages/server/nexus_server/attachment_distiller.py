"""Server-side re-export shim for the SDK's distillation pipeline.

The actual LLM-driven distillation logic lives at
:mod:`nexus_core.distiller` so any consumer of the SDK can reuse
it without re-implementing the extract / summarise / fall-back-to-head
dance. This module re-exports ``distill_attachment`` and
``extract_text`` under the legacy name the server's ``llm_gateway``
historically imported.

Phase B note: this module previously also owned
``record_distilled_event`` which wrote ``attachment_distilled`` rows
into ``sync_events`` for the legacy server-side data plane. That
plane is gone — the ``sync_events`` table itself was dropped — so
the persistence half is removed. Distilled summaries ride back to the
desktop inline in the chat response (``LLMChatResponse.attachment_summaries``);
no separate server-side persistence happens.
