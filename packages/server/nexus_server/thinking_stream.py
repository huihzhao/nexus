"""Server-Sent Events stream for live agent thinking.

Background
==========
The legacy /api/v1/agent/thinking endpoint polled twin's EventLog
filtered to a coarse list of event types. That gave the UI historical
breadcrumbs but no live reasoning — the user stared at a spinner,
then the answer appeared, then the past-tense thinking trace flashed.

This module exposes the SDK's ``ThinkingEmitter`` over a streaming
HTTP transport. The desktop opens one long-lived SSE connection per
chat surface; every step the agent runs (memory recall, tool call,
Gemini reasoning, evolution proposal, …) ships as soon as it fires.

Why SSE, not WebSocket
----------------------
Traffic is one-way (server → client). SSE has built-in reconnect, no
ping/pong needed, every browser/desktop HTTP client supports it
natively, and FastAPI's StreamingResponse renders the framing for
free. The only WebSocket affordance we'd want is bidirectional cancel,
which we don't need — disconnects are detected by the writer side.

Per-twin subscription
---------------------
We pull the user's twin via ``twin_manager.get_twin`` (which lazy-
constructs it on first chat if needed), then call ``twin.thinking.subscribe()``
to get a queue. The handler awaits events on that queue and serialises
them as SSE frames. On client disconnect (or server shutdown), the
handler unsubscribes so we don't leak bounded queues.
