"""
session_sync — Make session metadata (title, archived state, deletion)
durable across server migrations by routing every change through the
twin's EventLog.

Why this module exists
======================

Before this module, the only place the server knew that ``session_16fa``
was titled "BSC 调试" was the local SQLite ``nexus_sessions`` table.
The chat content of that session was already durable — it lives in
twin's EventLog, which mirrors to Greenfield + anchors on BSC. But the
**human-friendly metadata** (title, archived flag) was server-local.

So restoring from backup / migrating to a new VPS / wiping the SQL
volume would lose all titles. The sidebar would render
"session_16fa0e99 / session_acdaa106 / …" — an unfriendly UI even
though the underlying chat data is intact.

Design
======

Each session metadata change emits a ``session_metadata`` event into
twin's EventLog with this metadata schema::

    {
      "session_id": "session_16fa0e99",
      "action":     "create" | "rename" | "archive" | "unarchive" | "delete",
      "title":      "BSC 调试" | None,
      "archived":   true | false | None,
    }

Any ``None`` field means "not changed by this event". Replay applies
events oldest-first; last-write-wins per ``session_id``.

EventLog already does Greenfield mirror + BSC state-root anchor on
compaction, so these metadata events ride the same durability path as
chat messages — no new sync infrastructure.

Reconstruction at startup
=========================

``replay_session_metadata(user_id)`` walks the user's EventLog filtered
to ``event_type='session_metadata'`` (oldest first) and idempotently
re-applies each to the SQL ``nexus_sessions`` table. Called once when
TwinManager creates / loads a twin so a freshly-mounted DB rebuilds the
exact title/archive state the user last saw.
