"""Regression for the desktop's file upload path.

The /api/v1/files/upload endpoint silently went 404 in production
because nexus_server.main forgot to ``include_router(files.router)``
during a rename — the route was reachable in tests that imported the
router directly but the live FastAPI app didn't know it existed. The
desktop showed users a confusing ``Skipped: foo.pdf (Response status
code does not indicate success: 404 (Not Found).)`` for every drag-
dropped file.

These tests guard the wiring + the basic upload contract so that
regression can't happen quietly again.
