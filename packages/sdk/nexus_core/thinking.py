"""ThinkingEmitter — live agent reasoning telemetry.

Background
==========
The "thinking panel" used to be a polled view over twin's EventLog
events filtered to a coarse type list (heard / responded / decided …).
That gave the user historical breadcrumbs but never the *live* feel of
the agent reasoning — they stared at a spinner, then the answer
appeared, with the recall / tool calls / reasoning all collapsed into
the past tense.

This module is the foundation of the redesign. It's a tiny in-process
pub/sub: ``twin.chat`` calls ``emit(...)`` at every interesting decision
point during a turn, and any subscribers (today: a server-side SSE
broadcaster) get the events as they happen, with their original
sequence and timing preserved.

Design choices
--------------

* **Push, not pull.** Polling can never beat "show what just happened
  the moment it happened" — the desktop must see ``recall`` *before*
  ``reasoning`` and ``reasoning`` before ``tool_call`` because that's
  the actual order the agent did them in.

* **Per-twin queue, not global.** Each twin owns its own emitter so
  multi-tenant servers can subscribe per-user without filtering. The
  server's SSE endpoint resolves a twin via ``twin_manager.get_twin``
  and subscribes to that twin's emitter.

* **Best-effort and non-blocking.** ``emit`` uses
  ``Queue.put_nowait``. If a subscriber is too slow we drop the event
  rather than slow the chat path — the LLM call latency is the user's
  experience; thinking telemetry is gravy.

* **No dependence on EventLog.** Some thinking events (e.g. raw
  Gemini thinking tokens, mid-tool decisions) aren't durable — they
  don't belong in the event_log audit trail. Others (e.g.
  evolution_proposal) DO get persisted via the existing
  ``twin.event_log.append`` path. The emitter is parallel to, not
  instead of, EventLog.

Event taxonomy
--------------
``kind`` is one of (matches the desktop's ``ThinkingStepViewModel``):

  * ``heard``             — twin received a user turn
  * ``memory_recall``     — twin queried fact / episode / skill stores
  * ``reasoning``         — Gemini "thinking" tokens (chain-of-thought)
  * ``tool_call``         — twin invoked a tool
  * ``tool_result``       — tool returned (success or error)
  * ``insight``           — twin noted a new fact / contradiction
  * ``evolution_propose`` — twin proposed a falsifiable edit
  * ``replying``          — twin started streaming the final reply
  * ``replied``           — twin finished a turn

Each event also carries a ``turn_id`` (a per-twin monotonically
increasing integer assigned at the start of the chat turn) and a
``seq`` (a per-turn step counter). The desktop uses both to group
steps into turn cards and order them within a card.
