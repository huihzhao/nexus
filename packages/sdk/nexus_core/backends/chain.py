"""
ChainBackend — BSC + Greenfield storage for production.

Stores data on BNB Greenfield (decentralized object storage) and
anchors content hashes on BSC (BNB Smart Chain) for verifiability.

Performance architecture:
  - Local file cache for instant reads (no Greenfield roundtrip on startup)
  - Write-behind: writes go to local cache immediately, Greenfield sync
    happens asynchronously in a background thread so chat is never blocked
  - On shutdown, pending writes are flushed

Requires: web3, eth_account (pip install web3)
