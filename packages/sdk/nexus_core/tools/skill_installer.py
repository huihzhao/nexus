"""SkillInstallerTool + MCPInstallerTool — let the agent expand its
own capabilities at chat time.

Background
==========
Twin's persona prompt has long advertised "you can install new skills
from the LobeHub marketplace" but no actual install tool was ever
registered. The agent would dutifully tell the user it was "installing
a skill", then admit a few turns later that it could not actually
execute the install — frustrating for the user and a credibility hit
for the "self-evolving agent" pitch.

These two tools wrap the existing :class:`SkillManager` API
(``search_lobehub`` / ``install`` for Anthropic-style skills, and
``search_mcp`` / ``install_mcp`` for MCP servers) as ToolRegistry
entries the LLM can invoke via function calling.

Design notes
------------
* Each tool is split into search + install rather than one mega-tool,
  matching how the SDK's SkillManager exposes it. The LLM finds the
  right marketplace entry first, confirms the choice with the user
  (it's the LLM's job to ask), then installs by id. This keeps the
  install step explicit — the agent never installs something it
  hasn't first surfaced to the user.

* Both tools are NO-OP-safe when network is unavailable — the
  underlying manager catches httpx errors and returns empty lists /
  error dicts, which we surface to the LLM verbatim. The LLM can then
  apologise and suggest copying-pasting the relevant snippet, etc.

* MCP install needs a ``tool_registry`` so the newly installed MCP's
  tools can be registered into the live session. We pass ``None`` to
  the SDK helper, which installs the MCP definitions but doesn't
  register MCP tools onto the live ToolRegistry. Tools that need a
  full hot-load (without restart) can subclass and inject the live
  registry — for now the user restarts twin to pick up new MCP tools,
  matching the same pattern as Cursor / VS Code MCP integrations.
