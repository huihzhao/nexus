"""
Flush Policy & Write-Ahead Log — configurable write batching for Nexus.

Three-layer write architecture:
  Layer 1 (Hot):  In-memory buffer + local WAL file    ← every event
  Layer 2 (Warm): Greenfield upload                    ← batched every N events or T seconds
  Layer 3 (Cold): BSC state_root anchor                ← batched with Greenfield, or on critical events

The default FlushPolicy batches writes for performance. Users can override
to sync every event (maximum safety) or flush only on explicit call
(maximum control).

Usage:
    from nexus_core.flush import FlushPolicy

    # Default: batch every 5 events or 30 seconds
    policy = FlushPolicy()

    # Maximum safety: every event goes to chain
    policy = FlushPolicy.sync_every()

    # Maximum control: only flush when you say so
    policy = FlushPolicy.manual()

    # Custom: batch every 10 events, flush on task complete
    policy = FlushPolicy(every_n_events=10, interval_seconds=60)
