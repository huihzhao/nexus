Social Graph — Query and navigate the agent social network.

The graph is a directed, weighted, multi-edge graph:
  - Nodes: agents (ERC-8004 identities)
  - Edges: impressions (directed, from source to target)
  - Weight: compatibility_score

Built on top of ImpressionProvider — all data comes from stored impressions.
No separate graph storage needed (the impression store IS the graph).
